Pull built image from Crane to discover its image ID.

After squashing our image, the squashed image 'docker save' form will
have an image ID that is correct for its v2 schema 2
representation. However since Pulp does not yet support v2 schema 2,
we will need to remove that local image and re-pull it from Crane to
discover the image ID Docker will give it.
